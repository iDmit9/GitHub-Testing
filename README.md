GitHub don't be stupid, count my commits normally.
Now I'm doing the first commit

/////////

Yeah. As before commits created before push command counts twice.
Now I am gonna do commit after push,
and I thinc it will count normally

/////////

As expected commits created after push counts normally.
Now it shows 4 contributions: 1 for creating repo, 1 for commit after my local repo connected to GitHub, 2 for first commit (which should count as 1)

/////////

And now third commit, which will change my contributions to 5
